# high_dimensional_data_analytics
A glimpse into my coursework ISYE 8803 Topics on High-Dimensional Data Analytics, where I learnt analysis of high-dimensional structured data including profiles, images, and other types of functional data using statistical machine learning. A variety of topics such as functional data analysis, image processing, multilinear algebra and tensor analysis, and regularization in high-dimensional regression and its applications including low rank and sparse learning is covered. Optimization methods commonly used in statistical modeling and machine learning and their computational aspects are also discussed.
This repository includes my solution and write-up to the coursework of ISYE 8803 Topics on High-Dimensional Data Analytics.
